The rapid evolution of social media networks has provided grounds for fake accounts, which
pose risks like identity theft, online scams, and misinformation. The growing sophistication of fake accounts
has made their detection with traditional techniques very
difficult. To aid in this, we constructed a fully featured
fake profile detection system that uses behavioural analysis based on machine learning, NLP based sentiment
analysis on user bio and profile picture verification. The
system employs a Random Forest classifier that was
trained on behavioural features which included follower
and following counts, the nature of the username, privacy of the account, and language misuse in the accountâ€™s
bio. It achieved an accuracy of 96%. For profile picture
verification, the Mediapipe, Yandex Reverse Image
Search, and DeepFace along with the ViT model provided the best results in recognizing altered and fake images
achieving an accuracy of 96.5%. The combination of
these techniques provides a complete and effective approach to determining the existence of fake accounts
through behaviour analysis and image verification. The
accuracy for detection of fake profiles through these
means is 96.5%. This offers a complete method for detection of fake profiles through the synergy of the proposed
techniques.
